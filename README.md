# OnboardIQ test tasks

This is the repository for [OnboardIQ](https://onboardiq.com) test tasks.

Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, React.js, all that jazz. One task per folder.
Check the `README` inside.

Before starting the task, please read everything carefully and email us an
estimation: how many hours are you planning to invest in the task and when
it is due (for example, _"8 hours, you'll get it by Friday morning"_).

If you wish to fork the repository â€” sure, just please make sure your
fork is private.
